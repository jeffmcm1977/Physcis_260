This week we will learn how to solve differential equations, such as those that govern the time dependence of the electrical current in a circuit with resistors and capactiors. Although most simple circuits can be solved using a variety of techniques, more complex circuits, or more complex input signals, do not have easy paths to an exact solution.\n",

    "The solution to this equation is a function $x(t)$ whose first derivative is $f$.\n",
    "To find the solution to such an equation, we also need boundary conditions, or starting points.  Suppose that we have a first-order differential equation and know the value of $x$ for some specific time $t$, that is we know $x(t)$.  Then, we can write the value of x some short time later as\n",
