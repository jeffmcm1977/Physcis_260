This is why most introductory courses, like Phys260, typically restrict to examples with symmetries, like infinite straight wires, or the axis of symmetry of a loop. Computers have no such limitations, as we can sample over any configuration, regardless of symmetry (recall how we calculated the electric field due to a rectangular prism of charge).\n",
