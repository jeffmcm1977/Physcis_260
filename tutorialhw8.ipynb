    "This simple definition implies that many circuits can be expressed in the language of differential equations. The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to solve these equations numerically. \n",

    "\n",
    "The solution to this equation is a function $x(t)$ whose first derivative is $f$.\n",
    "To find the solution to such an equation, we also need boundary conditions, or starting points.  Suppose that we have a first-order differential equation and know the value of $x$ for some specific time $t$, that is we know $x(t)$.  The we can write the value of x some short time later as\n",

    "LaTeX (normally pronounced 'lah-tek' or 'lay-tek') is an incredibly useful typesetting language, and it pops up quite a bit in other settings as a way to write both inline and displayed equations, including in jupyter markdown cells. When you get to writing a thesis or academic paper it can become either your best friend or your worst enemy. Here we will focus on 'math mode', which allows us to write and format equations. There are multiple ways to enter math mode, the easiest is with in-line equations, using \\\\$  to contain your equation  (e.g. $y = mx + b$)\n",
